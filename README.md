#BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode

Xcode plugin to [uncrustify](https://github.com/bengardner/uncrustify) code in Xcode. 

## Requirements

Tested with Xcode 3.2.6 on OS X 10.6.8.

## Installation

* Build the Xcode project. The plug-in will automatically be installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. 

* Relaunch Xcode.

To uninstall, just remove the plugin from `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins` and restart Xcode.

## How does it work?

* Use the menu `Edit > Uncrustify Selection` to uncrustify the selected source code (multiple selection is not supported).

* Use the menu `Edit > Uncrustify Selected Files` to uncrustify the selected items in the project navigator.

* Use the menu `Edit > Uncrustify Active File` to uncrustify the source file actually opened in the editor. 

* Use the menu `Edit > Uncrustify Selected Lines` to uncrustify the selected source code (multiple selection is supported). The selection is automatically extended in full lines. If the selection is empty, it uses the line under the cursor.

PS: Modifications are recorded in the undo. So undo reverts the modifications.

You can create keyboard shortcuts for the menu items in the [Keyboard Preferences](http://support.apple.com/kb/ph6896) of OS X System Preferences.


## How to customize the uncrustify configuration?

By default, the plugin uses the configuration file `uncrustify.cfg` found in the bundle.

#### Per user configuration
To customize the configuration, copy the file `uncrustify.cfg` or your own to:

1. `uncrustify.cfg` in the same directory of your `.xcodeproj` file or
2. `~/.uncrustifyconfig` or
3. `~/uncrustify.cfg`

#### Per project configuration
A configuration file named `uncrustify.cfg` or `.uncrustifyconfig` can be defined for a project, a workspace or a Xcode container folder (folder with the yellow icon in the Xcode files navigator).

The lookup of the configuration file is made in this order:

1. Closest Xcode container folder ancestor.
2. Closest Xcode project file ('.xcodeproj') folder ancestor.
3. Closest Xcode workspace file ('.xcworkspace') folder ancestor.

Example:

```
|-- workspace.xcworkspace
|-- uncrustify.cfg
|-- project folder
|---- project.xcodeproj
|---- Third Party Library Folder
|------ uncrustify.cfg
|-- An other project folder
|---- An other project.xcodeproj
|---- uncrustify.cfg
````

### Using UncrustifyX

A more easy way to edit the configuration is to use the Mac appplication [UncrustifyX](https://github.com/ryanmaxwell/UncrustifyX). 

Once UncrustifyX is installed, the plugin will add a menu item `Open with UncrustifyX` to open the actual source code and configuration in UncrustifyX.

## Notes

After uncrustification, the plugin:

* performs a syntax-aware indenting if checked in the Xcode preferences (Preferences > Indentation > Syntax-aware indenting).

* Trims trailing whitespaces and white-only lines if not checked in the Xcode preferences (Preferences > Google > Correct Whitespace On Save).
